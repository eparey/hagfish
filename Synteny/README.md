# Synteny 

The files labelled `sp1-sp2_synt.txt` contain the reciprocal coordinates for a number of genome comparisons based on mutual-best-hits performed using `mmseqs2`. 

Binned stacked barplot representation such as that in Figure 2a are based on the `gchkExp` function in `plot_clg_hagfish.r`, while direct plotting of individual gene linkage between chromosomes such as that of Figure 2b is performed using `Rideogram` such as described in `ideogram.r`.
