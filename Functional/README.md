# Functional term enrichment

Functional (Gene Ontology) enrichment tests were performed on lists of paralogues showing specific retention patterns following the vertebrates WGDs using the script `ext_go.r`. Obtained functional enrichment results are provided in `Vert2R_Go_enrich_long_wg_gds.txt`. 

The complete list of gene families with lineage-specific losses is provided in `all_families_gain_loss.txt`. Functional enrichment results for the genes lost in hagfish (enrichment based on GO annotation for lamprey genes) is reported in `Loss_Lamprey_GO_gn_dsc.tsv`.
