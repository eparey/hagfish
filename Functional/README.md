# Functional term enrichment 

Functional enrichment (Gene Ontology) was performed on lists of paralogues showing particular retention in regard to the vertebrate WGD in `ext_go.r`. 

Results for the genes lost in hagfish (enrichment in lamprey) is reported in `Loss_Lamprey_GO_gn_dsc.tsv`. 

Results for the enrichement of genes showing alternative retention patterns after WGD is provided in `Vert2R_Go_enrich_long_wg_gds.txt`. 

List of gene families with the lineage specific losses is provided in Vert2R_Go_enrich_long_wg_gds.txt`all_families_gain_loss.txt`.
