# Code and data for reconstruction for gene family analyses

Gene families were first reconstructed using (Broccoli)[https://github.com/rderelle/Broccoli] (result file: `orthologous_groups.txt`), then individual alignments for families of suitable size were constructed, filter and processed with (Generax)[https://github.com/BenoitMorel/GeneRax] (resulting reconciliated tree: `bro_tree_0221.lab.tre`. 
`all_families_gain_loss.txt` summarises the results of the gain-and-loss analysis performed using the code in `gene_families.ipynb`. 

Selected reconciliated gene trees related to neural crest specification are included  in `selected trees` and labelled.
